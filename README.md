Our team, Code Crusaders, created a website on the 300 Spartans War in ancient Greece. Through our platform, we showcase the beginning, middle, and end of the battle, highlighting key events, strategies, and heroic sacrifices. Our goal is to bring history to life with an engaging and informative digital experience.
